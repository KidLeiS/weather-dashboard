## About The Project
Welcome to my weather dashboard application. Please have fun playing around with the tool (and feel free to use it to check weather forecasts!)

I am currently learning server party APIs with eDX's front end coding bootcamp, this is a showcase of the use of Open Weather Map's APIs to retreive their weather data and icon images. I also used DayJS for date-time formatting, JQuery for DOM traversal, localStorage for data persistence, and Bootstrap for viewport flexibility.

## Built With
- OpenWeather APIs
- Javascript, using jQuery and DayJS
- Bootstrapped HTML and CSS (starter code provided by eDX)

## Getting Started
No installation required, please go ahead and use it!

You can access the application at the following [link](https://kidleis.github.io/weather-dashboard/)

## Usage

The website should look like this after you search for weather conditions and forecast in a given city:

You can search for cities to retrieve their current weather as well as weather forecasts for the next 5 days. Once you search for a city, it should be saved in the search history bar (which will persist on localStorage). 

If you want to look up the forecast of previously searched cities, just click one of the city names in the search history.

Please note: Search History is not available for users with a screen width of 1000px or smaller.

## Roadmap
No roadmap! This is the final iteration of this relatively simple tool!
